## Since there was no SRS, I have done this assignment in a notebook. 

# General remarks:

### Note that the column "days_since_reg" was not inside the activities.csv, so therefore the calculation of days since registration for each activity
### will be calculated respective to the date when each user was registered (in the system).

The description of the task was sometimes unclear and had me to do some guess work, especially :

in the question "What is the total mean and median revenue generated per user (ie across all activities)? How do you interpret the result?"
I first thought of the average of revenue of a single day but not for all the week, and realized by the end that It makes more sense to count the total revenue per week. 

the regression question had too much noise and had only 1 variable that was useful, although the dataset has more valueable variables.
